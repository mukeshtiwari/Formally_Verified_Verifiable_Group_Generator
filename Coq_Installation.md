* First install [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html) (see `Binary distribution`)
* Once opam is installed on the system, follow the instructions given on [Coq Opam](http://coq.io/opam/get_started.html)
* If everything goes well, then you have Coq installed (you can check it using `which coqtop` and it should output `your-home-directory/.opam/default/bin/coqtop`)
* Now navigate to directory where _CoqProject exists and simply run `make` (the time it wil take will vary from 1 minute to 30 minutes)
